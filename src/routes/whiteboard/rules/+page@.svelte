Maybe you could relate the model to something you see in everyday life. Like Projectile Motion to a snowball fight. We want you to be creative when it comes to developing your models. When you take your model beyond just being a simulation, and you turn it into something that's a part of your other projects, that's when you'll score highly. Other reasons you could score highly are by including creative parameters </td>

    <h1 class="text-6xl font-bold text-neutral-700 mb-10 text-center mt-10">Ranking + Scoring Explanation</h1>
    <h3 class="font-bold text-2xl">Weekly Rankings</h3>
    <p class="text-xl font-pangolin"> Rankings will be determined by the sum of the scores from each category, plus any applicable bonuses. The highest total score will rank first, and so on.</p>
    <p class="text-xl font-pangolin"> In the event of a tie, both submissions will be ranked at the same position, and the following ranking will be incremented by 1.</p>
    <h3 class="font-bold text-2xl mt-2"> Overall Event superscoring</h3>
    <p class="text-xl font-pangolin"> The overall event superscoring will be determined by the sum of the weekly rankings (excluding thier single worst ranking), with the lowest score winning. I.e if someone ranks 1st in weeks 1&2, 2nd in weeks 3&4, and 10th in weeks 5&6, their overall superscore would be 3, as the 10th is excluded. and they would beat someone who ranked 12th in weeks 1&2, and 3rd in weeks 3&4 and 5&6, with an overall score of 6, as their 12th is excluded. This system is similar to that used in the sport of sailing, and is explained on wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-point_system" class="font-pangolin hover:text-blue-400 hover:underline text-bold text-blue-700">here</a>.</p>
    <h3 class="font-bold text-2xl mt-2"> What If I don't do a week?</h3>
    <p class="text-xl font-pangolin"> If you don't submit anything for a given week, you will be assigned the maximum ranking + 1 for that week (i.e if 30 people submitted, you will be assigned 31st place). This will count towards your overall superscore, unless it is your single worst ranking, in which case it will be excluded.</p>
